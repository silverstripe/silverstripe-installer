#
# Whitelist appropriate assets files.
# Note that you will need to maintain this whitelist yourself if you modify File::$allowed_extensions
#
# If you are not using Apache then you can ignore this file.
# If you are using IIS then you should look at assets/web.config instead.
#
# To add an extension to the list, you need to put another string of the form "ext|" on the
# FilesMatch line, inside the parentheses. 
#
# For example, to add *.exe files to list of downloadable assets, change this line: 
#
#   <FilesMatch "\.(html|htm|xhtml...
#
# To this:
#
#   <FilesMatch "\.(exe|html|htm|xhtml...
#
# Once you do this, visitors will be able to download *.exe files that are uploaded to the assets
# directory.
#
# For compatibility reasons, we include uppercase versions of allowed extensions, as Apache 1.3
# does not support regular expression case insensitive matches using PCRE style.
